Requirements Checks off 
1.  showcases procedural generation
        function.js     line 371-657
        fixer function do the procedural generation work to fix the random generation based on the rules

2.  be interactive (either explorable or playable)
        function.js     line 664-738
        slime will be generated by the mouse click (inner ground tiles only)
        it won't be on the rock object or frog object
        it will become red if u click the green slime that is already existed
        it will disappear if u click the red slime


3.  should have at least one element of "infinite" variation
        seagulls in object.js is generated and moved infinitively
        tiles generation is using noise and bsp rooms are also generated infinitively (just refresh the page)


4.  should have at least one "sign of life" that is not central to the main interactive mechanism       
        the main interactive mechanism: mouse click to make slime, refresh the page to make different map (could make button, but too pointless to make a button just to change seed)
        additional "sign of life": seagull and click on green/red slime


5.  use at least one technique/approach/method for PCG that was not used in one of the programming assignments
        BSP tree to generate rooms
        the rooms position adjustment and tile_array control
        collision control
        color of slime spawned based on the object next to it (spawn next to frog will become red slime)
